Hi, I am a **programmer** and **webdeveloper** from Poland. 

I started my adventure with programming in early 90's, when I was still using **Commodore 64** computer and learning **BASIC**. 
Next was **PASCAL**, and at the beginning of XXI century I started to be interested in web development and **PHP** language. 
I still remember the times when I was using PHP version 3.0, there was no **jQuery** framework and the website looked differently on different browsers. 
Those were hard times for developers ;)

Currently I'm still programming, and in my spare time I sell phonograph records (vinyls), CDs and cassettes in my own online store called [**Winyle Online**](https://winyle-online.pl/).

See my profile on [**StackOverflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2932013/robert).
